In Go, it is not possible to import the same package name from two different sub-directories directly. Each package in Go must have a unique name, and when importing packages, the import path is used to identify the package.

If you attempt to import the same package name from two different sub-directories, you will encounter a compilation error indicating that the package name is already in use. This is because the package name is derived from the last segment of the import path.

To work around this limitation, you can use different import aliases for each package to disambiguate them. By assigning different aliases to the packages with the same name, you can use the aliases to refer to the respective packages in your code.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```go
package main

import (
	alias1 "example.com/pkg1"
	alias2 "example.com/pkg2"
)

func main() {
	alias1.DoSomething()
	alias2.DoSomething()
}
```

In this example, `pkg1` and `pkg2` are two different sub-directories, both of which contain a package with the same name. By importing them with different aliases (`alias1` and `alias2`), you can use these aliases to refer to the respective packages within your code.

Note that it's generally advisable to choose meaningful and descriptive aliases to make your code more readable.
